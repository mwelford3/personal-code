 This contains the my portion of the group project I completed making visualizations for Data Visualization for the WNIJ radio station on COVID-19 vaccinations at Northern Illinois nursing homes with Harish Varma Siravuri and Yue Ma.<br>
 <h3>Included Files:</h3>
 <ul>
   <li><b>WNIJ_Initial_Data_Exploration_Michael.ipynb</b> contains my initial exploration of the COVID-19 non-time series nursing home dataset using Pandas and Matplotlib with the following steps:
    <ol>
      <li>Finding a description of the initial dataset</li>
      <li>Checking for facilities with missing data</li>
      <li>Creating new resident and staff vaccination rate attributes</li>
      <li>Getting a correlation plot of the numerical attributes</li>
     <li>Plotting the five counties in IL with the highest/lowest staff vaccination rates</li>
     <li>Creating a scatterplot of the Resident Total Confirmed Cases vs. Staff Total Confirmed Cases</li>
     <li>Creating histograms of each numerical attribute.</li>
     <li>Repeating the above for just counties in Northern Illinois</li>
    </ol>
    </li><br>
  <li><b>WNIJ_TimeSeries_Data_Exploration_Michael.ipynb</b> contains my initial exploration of the COVID-19 time-series nursing home dataset using Pandas and <a href="https://altair-viz.github.io/index.html">Vega-Altair</a>. The following plots were produced:
   <ol>
     <li>Top 10 Counties in IL by Deaths</li>
     <li>Top 10 Facilties by Percentage Vaccinated Staff</li>
     <li>Top 10 Facilities by Percentage Vaccinated Residents</li>
     <li>Bottom 10 Facilities by Percentage Vaccinated Staff</li>
     <li>Bottom 10 Facilities by Percentage Vaccinated Residents</li>
   </ol>
  </li><br>
  <li><b>updated_wnij_notebook_6_3_2022.ipynb</b> contains the code for creating the finalized versions of the plot for the news article.</li>
 </ul>
